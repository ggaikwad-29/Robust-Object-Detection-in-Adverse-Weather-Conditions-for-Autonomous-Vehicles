# Robust-Object-Detection-in-Adverse-Weather-Conditions-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
This project aims to develop a robust object detection system for autonomous vehicles that can perform accurately under adverse weather conditions. The solution addresses challenges such as reduced visibility, noise, and distortion of critical features, enhancing detection accuracy and reducing the risk of accidents.
